#summary About the OpenMeetings LdapIntegration

In $RED5_HOME/webapps/openmeetings/conf

you will find sample configurations for LDAP and Active Directory.
The nature of those Directory Servers are that they are individual for every organization, so you have to modify of course at least the path to your user-base et cetera.

To activate any of those configurations you have to login into OpenMeetings, goto Administration > Ldap.

<<Screen>>

You can configure multiple domains or different user-paths in the Administration of !OpenMeetings.
