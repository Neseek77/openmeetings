= Hardware Requirements =

  * Minimalistic requirement (without Document Converters, Recorder and Upload feature)  1GHz CPU 1 GB RAM
  * Recommended requirement 2x/4x 2GHz ++ CPU (32 or 64Bit) 4GB RAM. If you have a 64Bit Operating System check if there is a !OpenOffice 64Bit Version [http://download.openoffice.org/other.html#de available for your OS]

  * Headset/Microphone recommendation: Logitech !ClearChat PC Wireless, for example from [http://www.amazon.de/Logitech-ClearChat-kabelloser-Kopfh%C3%B6rer-Transmitter/dp/B00166WSN4 Amazon] or [http://shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=Logitech+ClearChat+Wireless&_sacat=0&_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&LH_BIN=1&LH_IncludeSIF=1&_odkw=Logitech+ClearChat+PC&_osacat=0 EBay Auctions]

== Software Requirements / Dependencies ==

  * Java Version greater or equal 6
  * Database available (MySQL,Postgres,... MSSQL,Oracle,DB2 see [http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html#configuration-optional-dialects full-list]) It is recommended to make/use an empty database/scheme
  Database MUST listen and allow TCP/IP connections! And the default character-set/scheme must be UTF8! _For example_ a fresh MySQL does *not* listen on TCP/IP by default and has *not* utf8 as default-character-set defined. You have to change these settings and restart your database server so that changes take effect (mysql-config is in my.cnf). Postgres for example does also not listen by default on TCP/IP but uses by default UTF8 (since postgres 7 or 8). To change Postgres listening on TCP/IP check postgresql.conf and add your host to the pg_hba.conf. In Postgres you need to create a database using *template1* cause template1 create automatically a scheme called *public* which is needed (and since postgres 8 you can use several schemes inside one database public is the default one [http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/interactive/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PATH Postgres-Docs]).
  * *!OpenOffice-Service* started and listening on port 8100 (see OpenOfficeConverter, this is not necessary for installation but for running later on)
  * Installed *!ImageMagick* (this is not necessary for installation but for running later on), you can get more information on http://www.imagemagick.org regarding installation. The instructions for installation can be found there http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php, however on most linux systems you can get it via your favorite package managers (apt-get it)
  * Installed *!GhostScript* (this is not necessary for installation but for running later on), you can get more information on http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/ regarding installation. The instructions for installation can be found there, however on most linux systems you can get it via your favorite package managers (apt-get it).
  * Installed *SWFTools* (this is not necessary for installation but for running later on), you can get more information on http://www.swftools.org/ regarding installation. Some of the Linux distributions already have it in there package manager see http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/swftools), the recommended version of *SWFTools* is 0.9 as prior version have a bug that does lead to wrong object dimensions in the Whiteboard
  * Install *FFMpeg* (this is not necessary for installation but if you want to test the recording you have to install it). You should get FFMPEG in an up to date copy! For Windows you can download a Build for example from http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/builds/ Linux or OSx Users should be able to use one of the various Installation Instructions on the Web. You need to enable libmp3lame!
  * Install *SoX* (this is not necessary for installation but if you want to test the recording you have to install it). You should install SoX in a up to date copy! SoX 12.xx will NOT work!
  * MAC OSx / Linux Users => Get Flash Player 10 Beta!! It fixes the CPU Problem for Streaming Video => http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/

== Install !OpenMeetings ==

  # Download [http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/files/openmeetings_1_5_rc1_r3393.zip OpenMeetings including Red5]
  # Unpack it (Please make sure that you use an up-to-date unzip-software) (and copy it somewhere in you system, do not start it from your Windows Desktop)
  # you have now a folder openmeetings_version_no_xx
  # Prepare Database Settings - go to openmeetings_version_no_xx/webapps/openmeetings/conf/hibernate.cfg.xml 
    * MySQL-Database-User: Rename `mysql_hibernate.cfg.xml` to `hibernate.cfg.xml` and alter following config values in (`mysql_`)`hibernate.cfg.xml`
     {{{
		<property name="connection.username">root</property>
		<property name="connection.password"></property>

		<property name="connection.url">jdbc:mysql://YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE</property>	
     }}}
    If you have problems in connecting your database, a common error is that the Database does not listen to TCP/IP Connection, or you properly need to replace the jdbc-driver with the one for your database-version.
    Of course you must alter `YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE` to fit your needs for example to:`jdbc:mysql://localhost/openmeetings`
    * Postgres-Database-Users: Rename `postgres_hibernate.cfg.xml` to `hibernate.cfg.xml` and alter following config values in (`postgres_`)`hibernate.cfg.xml`
    {{{
		<!-- User  / Password -->
		<property name="connection.username">postgres</property>
		<property name="connection.password"></property>
		
		<property name="connection.url">jdbc:postgresql://YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE</property>	
    }}}
    Of course you must alter `YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE` to fit your needs for example to:`jdbc:postgresql://localhost/openmeetings`
    * Any-Database-Users: Rename `any_hibernate.cfg.xml` to hibernate.cfg.xml. 
    Alter the following config values to fit your needs:
    {{{
		<!-- User  / Password -->
		<property name="connection.username">user</property>
		<property name="connection.password">*****</property>
		
		<!-- Database Settings -->
		<property name="connection.driver_class">org.postgresql.Driver</property>
		<property name="dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect</property>
		<property name="connection.url">jdbc:postgresql://localhost/openmeetings</property>	
		
    }}}
    You can see a list of available _dialect_'s here [http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.3/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html#configuration-optional-dialects hibernate-SQL-dialects]. You must download the driver for your database and copy it to _$OPENMEETINGS-HOME/WEB-INF/lib_
  # (Re)start Red5 (The table's will be automatically created by hibernate if there is something wrong with your database values you will see errors in Red5 logfile 
  # go to the Installer by accessing it via browser: http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/install and follow the instructions 

After Running the Installer all basics are installed. Now login and go to the Meeting-Rooms and check all features. You possibly will have some difficulties uploading files. Check if !OpenOffice is really running, swftool, !ImageMagick (including !GhostScript, FFMpeg) is available on  your System-Path (or your customize the path in the Configuration).

== Hidden and experimental features ==

  * rtmps (using of SSL) => you find in the config.xml some value to enable the client to first try to connect to rtmps (useSSL param) .. NOTE: Flash Player only on Windows have the rtmps feature and you will need to clear your browser cache to force a reload of the updated config.xml
  * if you resize your own video-pod in the conference much larger and then synchronize  the stream, all clients will get a better picture (it also needs more bandwidth, as it will take the actual new height / width numbers to publish your stream)
  * there are some hidden emoticons (for example (activate)), you might want to add your own ones [http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webapp/webapp/openmeetings/public/emoticons/emotes.xml Full List]

== Integration, Single Sign On and LDAP ==

  * To Integrate !OpenMeetings it is recommended to use the [http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/wiki/SoapMethods SOAP-Gateway]
  * Regarding LDAP-Configuration see the Installer Script and sample Configuration 

= using 3th Party Publishing Software, RTP-Streams or IP-Cams =

  * If you want to integrate 3th Party Software for publishing Live-Video you may have a look at [http://www.xuggle.com Xuggler]. There is no out of the Box solution but there are already people successfully publish their usual [http://www.red5wiki.com/wiki/SteamStream RTP-LiveStream] by using Xuggler

== Ports, NAT Settings, Customize ==

  * Default Ports: 1935 (RTMP), 8088 (RTMP-Over HTTP), 5080 (HTTP), 4445 ([ODSP Desktop Sharing]), 8443 (RTMP over SSL)  for alternate Port settings have a look at red5/conf/red5.properties. Don't forget that you have also some port settings in the Client, see the red5/webapps/openmeetings/config.xml
  * Custom Colors, Default Language, see red5/webapps/openmeetings/config.xml
  * You may be able to run different red5 instances if you bind it to specific ports. 
  * Single Sing On, Integration => Use the Remote Gateway with the SoapMethods

= Service for Customization / Installation =

 * Need for a developer or Consultant? [http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/wiki/Jobs Hire a Developer]

== Tips and Tricks ==

  * To run openmeetings behind a Apache Web-Server you can try with apache mod_jk and mod_proxy
  * Watch the ScreenCast of 0.5.2/SVN-Version Basic Installation http://blip.tv/file/836696?filename=Kunthar-OpenmeetingsBasicInstallation696.flv 
  * French version of Installation Instructions: http://flash.54n.free.fr/?/Root/Debian/OpenMeetings-Installation
  * Use the Debug-Application: Enter in your browser http://$RED-HOST:$RED5-PORT/openmeetings/maindebug.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf for example http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/maindebug.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf
  * If you have Problems with conversion-jobs check your Red5-Log output. There will be error Messages which help you. You must install !OpenOffice, !ImageMagick, !GhostScript and SWFTools to run all conversion-Jobs correctly.
  * if you have problems in converting Files check the Batch-Scripts in $OPENMEETINGS_HOME/jod
  * If you want to use red5 as a service (without red5.bat), you need to move red5\wrapper\wrapper.exe to red5\wrapper.exe. Then change some path in conf\wrapper.conf (like ..\lib\foo.jar to lib\foo.jar). And finally change the register key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Red5\ImagePath to point to the new wrapper.
  * you can query a Mysql Database to get the schema_collection by using this query: 
{{{
SELECT Table_name, TABLE_COLLATION FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'openmeetings' ORDER BY table_name DESC
}}}
