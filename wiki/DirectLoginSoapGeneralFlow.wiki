#summary General Flow of Direct-Login/Managing Rooms with SOAP-Gateway
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

== Description ==

The Application Logic of the environment holds an ID of the Room and manages the Room.
If the ID is created the Room will be created into !OpenMeetings using the SOAP-Gateway.
If a user wants to directly login into that room he does that in two basic steps (Phase 2 and Phase 3 in the Graph):
  # Sets the User session (getSession, loginUser, setUserObject)
  # Login into the Room, by adding the !RoomId and the SID to the URL
  
If the Room needs Password Protection, then this must be implemented in the Application-Logic while 
managing the Room (Application Logic of the environment). Also this environment has to take care that
the room will be deleted if it is not needed anymore.
Additional features on the RoadMap: Access-Log for each room and limit set an overall Room Limit. For example that
the SOAP-Client is forced to delete old rooms cause he has expired his maximum. This could be used to control 
the Maximum User per Server.
