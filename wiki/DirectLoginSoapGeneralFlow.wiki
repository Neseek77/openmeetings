#summary General Flow of Direct-Login/Managing Rooms with SOAP-Gateway
#labels Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

_This Feature will is available since Version 0.5.1_

== Summary ==

The trick about the !DirectLogin-Flow (SSO) is that you can go into a room directly without having any !OpenMeetings account. You always use the same (Admin!!) user to login via the Web-Service and then use the !setUserObject method to set custom user-value to a specific session.

== Description ==

The Application Logic of the environment holds an ID of the Room and manages the Room.
If the ID is created the Room will be created into !OpenMeetings using the SOAP-Gateway.
If a user wants to directly login into that room he does that in two basic steps (Phase 2 and Phase 3 in the Graph):
  # Sets the User session (getSession, loginUser, setUserObject)
  # Login into the Room, by adding the !RoomId and the SID to the URL
  
If the Room needs Password Protection, then this must be implemented in the Application-Logic while 
managing the Room (Application Logic of the environment). Also this environment has to take care that
the room will be deleted if it is not needed anymore.
Additional features on the RoadMap: Access-Log for each room and limit set an overall Room Limit. For example that
the SOAP-Client is forced to delete old rooms cause he has expired his maximum. This could be used to control 
the Maximum User per Server.

URL for direct Room access: (sid=6c280410c96e91ea05d25e0b28b10a87 MUST be replaced with a valid SID you create using the SOAP Gateway)
http://$YOUR_RED5_HOST:$YOUR_RED5_HTTP_PORT/openmeetings/main.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf?roomid=1&sid=6c280410c96e91ea05d25e0b28b10a87&language=4
or
http://$YOUR_RED5_HOST:$YOUR_RED5_HTTP_PORT/openmeetings/main.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf?roomid=1&sid=6c280410c96e91ea05d25e0b28b10a87
(see the missing language_id, in this case it will use the default_language_id from the configuration section)
