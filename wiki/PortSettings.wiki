#summary OpenMeetings Port settings

== Default Configuration ==

  * Port 5080: HTTP
  * Port 1935: RTMP (Flash Stream and Remoting)
  * Port 8088: RTMP over HTTP-Tunneling (rtmpT)

Additionally red5 uses some ports internally. However those ports are not in use by !OpenMeetings by deault.

== Configure alternative ports ==

You need to change two files:

  * Server-Side configuration: $RED5_HOME/conf/red5.properties, you need to restart the red5-service so that changes are online.
  * Client-Side configuration: $RED5_HOME/webapps/openmeetings/config.xml 
    Every server side configuration has a client side representive
