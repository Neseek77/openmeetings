=== *Renaming `/openmeetings` _context_* ===
If you want to have `http://yourcorp.com:5080/yourmeetings` instead of `http://yourcorp.com:5080/openmeetings` you need to do the following
  # stop openmmetings if it is running
  # go to openmeetings install dir (for ex. `/opt/red5`)
  # rename `/opt/red5/webapps/openmeetings` to `/opt/red5/webapps/yourmeetings` (for ex. `mv /opt/red5/webapps/openmeetings /opt/red5/webapps/yourmeetings`)
  # open `/opt/red5/webapps/yourmeetings/config.xml` using your favorite text editor (for ex. `vim /opt/red5/webapps/yourmeetings/config.xml`)
  # find and modify `<webAppRootKey>openmeetings</webAppRootKey>` to be `<webAppRootKey>`*yourmeetings*`</webAppRootKey>`
  # find and modify `<httpRootKey>openmeetings</httpRootKey>` to be `<httpRootKey>`*yourmeetings*`</httpRootKey>`
That's it

=== *Changing hard-coded application name in string labels* ===
To have _Your Application Name_ instead of _Openmeetings_ in *all* text labels you need to do the following
  # ensure *`$APP_NAME`* placeholder is used in _all_ strings you have added and/or modified (all strings bundled into Openmeetings already have this placeholder)
  # login to Openmeetings as user with administrator privileges
  # go to `Administration -> Configuration`
  # find and edit configuration with name *`application.name`*
  # Set its value to be _`Your Application Name`_
  # `Save`
  # reload page or relogin
All string will display _`Your Application Name`_ in place of _`Openmeetings`_
