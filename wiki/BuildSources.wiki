= Source Locations Developer Version =

You need to compile two apps:
  * Client - build with OpenLaszlo
  * Webapp - Java-Webapp

= Openlaszlo Client (Client-Side) =

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/

for compiling the client you need to install the Open-Laszlo-Server:
http://www.openlaszlo.org

place the content of 
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/xmlcrm/videoconference/

Step-By-Step:
  * Download and Install Open-Laszlo 4.0.6 (Version > 4.0.5 is needed!)
  * Checkout from the SVN using http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/ as root of your Project ($CLIENT_SOURCE_ROOT)
  * Copy the directory videoconference of $CLIENT_SOURCE_ROOT/xmlcrm/ into your Openlaszlo -WebRoot ($LPS-HOME/Server/lps-4.0.5/) ... on Windows your Path if you're using the default one's will look like C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 4.0.5/Server/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/... 
  * alter the config.xml in videoconference/config.xml (for example C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 4.0.5/Server/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/config.xml) ... _rtmphostlocal should match the IP/domain of your red5-streaming server (if its on the same IP like your Openlaszlo-Server you can leave it blank)
  * Start OpenLaszlo Server and run: http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/maindebug.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo and http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/main.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo

= Java Webapp (Server-Side) =

1.) Download (SVN - Checkout) from:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/
2.) change dir your local copy
3.) Run: ant dist
there is now a directory dist, inside of that directory there is a compiled red5-webapp.
You have to copy the Laszlo-Client from the Step-By-Step scenario into it.
