------------
As result of improving and simplifying the development process
we changed the Source Locations

Please consider new Instructions and new Source Locations from BuildSourceNew

Old Instructions - these are valid for versions prior and including 0.9 RC5

= Source Locations Developer Version =

You need to compile two apps:
  * Client - build with !OpenLaszlo
  * Webapp - Java-Webapp
  you need both! and you should use the same revision number (SVN Revision number) !


= Openlaszlo Client (Client-Side) =

SVN URL: http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/openmeetings_lps411/

Browse in Code with Browser: http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/source/browse/trunk/openmeetings_lps411/

for compiling the client you need to install the !OpenLaszlo-Server 4.3.0:
http://openlaszlo.org/download

Step-By-Step:
  * Download and Install !OpenLaszlo 4.x.x(4.5.1 and higher) from http://www.openlaszlo.org/download
  * create a directory *openmeetings* into your !OpenLaszlo-WebRoot directory ($LPS-HOME/Server/lps-4.x.x/) ... on Windows your Path if you're using the default one's will look like C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 
  * Checkout from the SVN using http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/source/browse/trunk/openmeetings_lps411/ as root of your Project ($CLIENT_SOURCE_ROOT) into the directory *openmeetings* you have created
  * alter the config.xml in ($LPS-HOME/Server/lps-4.x.x/openmeetings/)config.xml (for example C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 4.x.x/Server/lps-4.x.x/openmeetings/config.xml) ... _rtmphostlocal_ should match the IP/domain of your red5-streaming server (if its on the same IP like your Openlaszlo-Server you can leave it blank)
  * Start OpenLaszlo Server and run (lps-4.x.x = lps-4.x.x if this is your !Openlaszlo version: http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.x.x/videoconference/maindebug.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo  (with debugger) and /or http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.x.x/videoconference/main.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo

= Java Webapp (Server-Side) =

  * You need Java Version = 6 for running and compiling !OpenMeetings
  * Install red5 from http://build.xuggle.com/job/red5_jdk6_stable/
  * Download (SVN - Checkout) from:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webapp/
  * change dir your local copy
  * Run: ant dist (JAVA_HOME must be set and point to a JDK = 1.6 and you need ant version = 1.7)
  * there is now a directory *dist*, inside of that directory there is a compiled openmeetings-webapp with the name *openmeetings*
  * use the compiled openmeetings-webapp and copy it to $RED5_HOME/webapps
  * remove the jar: *antlr-3.1.2.jar* from the red5-lib directory to avoid Class Loader Problems
  * do the usual install process of openmeetings

Additional Notes:
  # You have to copy the Laszlo-Client from the Step-By-Step scenario into it to make a complete Binary, but you can also run it from inside OpenLaszlo Server. You only need to place a *crossdomain.xml* into $RED5_HOME/webapps/root, otherwise the Flash-Security-Sandbox will not allow Up- or Downloads.
  # If you want to keep the previous installation and only change some Java code but no Database structure it is enough if you just copy/overwrite the folder *WEB-INF* and restart red5.

Comment by kunthar,  Today (20 minutes ago) 10.01.2008

Notes on building sources;

If you see error fields on login form it means you didnt run Install yet and necessary fields in Db is NOT yet populated.

Basic steps; After checkout fresh copy from svn repo (windows users look for tortoise svn, linux users already knows what to do, hehe), 
  # set JAVA_HOME to jdk 1.5/1.6 or greater,
  # run ant dist at where build.xml located, 
  # copy openmeetings dir which is inside of dist to red5 server webapps dir, 
  # change config.xml and install/hibernate.cfg.xml to wanted db connection, (dont forget to run mysql or any db at this moment) 
  # copy main.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf and maindebug.lzx.lzr=swf8.swf to red5 webapps dir, 
  # run http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/Install (not install case sensitive) 
  # watch populated fields from red5 console, it takes a time, grab o coffee :) 
  # Finally run http://localhost:5080/openmeetings All paths relative, be careful.

Final note: Every little change effects immediately when you refresh browser window while you work with Laszlo. And comment is <!-- --> lines Hope it helps some one, Happy coding
