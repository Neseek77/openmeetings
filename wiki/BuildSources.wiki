LaszloClient:

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/

for compiling the client you need to install the Open-Laszlo-Server:
http://www.openlaszlo.org

place the content of 
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/xmlcrm/videoconference/

and you need to replace the rtmpconnection.lzx from your OpenLaszlo Installation with this one:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/xmlcrm/patches/lps403/


Java Layer:

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/

There is a empty skeleton of the webapp inside the directory:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/webapp/

you need to build a jar file (xmlcrm.jar) based on the content of:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/src/app/
but without the hibernate.cfg.xml inside of it (cause this file is loaded from the file system _not_ from the jar file.

To edit the template's (for example for mailings, installation) you need to compile a jar file (xmlcrm-templates.jar) based on the content of:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/src/templates/

both jar files should be inside of the WEB-INF/lib/-directory of the webapp:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/webapp/xmlcrm/WEB-INF/lib/

you can download the latest Beta-release and replace the jar-files there to get a complete list of all used jar-liberaries

== TODO ==

write an ant-task to compile a binary release of the webapp
