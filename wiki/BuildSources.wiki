You need to compile two apps:
  * Client - build with OpenLaszlo
  * Webapp - Java-Webapp

= Openlaszlo Client (Client-Side) =

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/

for compiling the client you need to install the Open-Laszlo-Server:
http://www.openlaszlo.org

place the content of 
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/xmlcrm/videoconference/

Step-By-Step:
  * Download and Install Open-Laszlo 4.0.5 (Version 4.0.5 is needed!)
  * Checkout from the SVN using http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/laszlo/client/ as root of your Project ($CLIENT_SOURCE_ROOT)
  * Copy the directory videoconference of $CLIENT_SOURCE_ROOT/xmlcrm/ into your Openlaszlo -WebRoot ($LPS-HOME/Server/lps-4.0.5/) ... on Windows your Path if you're using the default one's will look like C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 4.0.5/Server/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/... 
  * alter the config.xml in videoconference/config.xml (for example C:/Program Files/Openlaszlo Server 4.0.5/Server/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/config.xml) ... _rtmphostlocal should match the IP/domain of your red5-streaming server (if its on the same IP like your Openlaszlo-Server you can leave it blank)
  * Start OpenLaszlo Server and run: http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/maindebug.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo and http://localhost($LPS-HOST):8080/lps-4.0.5/videoconference/main.lzx?lzr=swf8&lzproxied=solo

= Java Webapp (Server-Side) =

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/

There is a empty skeleton of the webapp inside the directory:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/webapp/

you need to build a jar file (xmlcrm.jar) based on the content of:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/src/app/
but without the hibernate.cfg.xml inside of it (cause this file is loaded from the file system _not_ from the jar file.

To edit the template's (for example for mailings, installation) you need to compile a jar file (xmlcrm-templates.jar) based on the content of:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/src/templates/

both jar files should be inside of the WEB-INF/lib/-directory of the webapp:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/webapp/xmlcrm/WEB-INF/lib/

you can download the latest Beta-release and replace the jar-files there to get a complete list of all used jar-liberaries

== TODO ==

write an ant-task to compile a binary release of the webapp
