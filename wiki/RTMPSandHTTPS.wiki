#summary Using OpenMeetings with RTMPS and HTTPS

There are 3 ways the client communicates with the server:
  * The flash-client uses RTMP protocol to transfer Audio/Video and to send and receive the user data (login et cetera) to the server and back
  * The browser uses HTTP protocol to load the SWF and to upload and download the files (documents, pdfs, images) to the server and back.
  * The screensharing client uses RTMP protocol to transfer screen data and remote control to the server and back

== Prerequisites ==

  # Install OpenMeetings according to the install instructions and check that it runs without problems
  # Rename the existing keystore file red5/conf/keystore to keystore.bak
