= Install latest Red5 Server =

  * you can get the latest Version of Red5 from: http://www.osflash.org
  * configure Red5, the default ports Red5 is listening are also the default ports openmeetings application will try to connect. However you will find the exact port settings in _$RED5-HOME/conf/red5.properties_ (or follow the installation of red5)

= Install Openmeetings =
  # Download Openmeetings 0.5 Rc3 (beta3) from [ http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/downloads/list Openmeetings-Download-Page]
  # Unpack it to _$RED5-HOME/webapps/_ your new folder structure will be _$RED5-HOME/webapps/xmlcrm/_ this is the base directory of Openmeetings (following $OPENMEETINGS-HOME)
  # Prepare Database Settings - goto $OPENMEETINGS-HOME/install there are two preconfigured files for MySQL and Postgres: mysql_hibernate.cfg.xml and postgres_hibernate.cfg.xml. Following explains it for MySQL-Database-Users, Postgres-Database-Users and Any-Database-Users. Choose Your One!! 
    * MySQL-Database-User: Rename `mysql_hibernate.cfg.xml` to `hibernate.cfg.xml` and alter following config values in (`mysql_`)`hibernate.cfg.xml`
     {{{
		<property name="connection.username">root</property>
		<property name="connection.password"></property>

		<property name="connection.url">jdbc:mysql://YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE</property>	
     }}}
    Of course you must alter `YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE` to fit your needs for example to:`jdbc:mysql://localhost/xmlcrm`
    * Postgres-Database-Users: Rename `postgres_hibernate.cfg.xml` to `hibernate.cfg.xml` and alter following config values in (`postgres_`)`hibernate.cfg.xml`
    {{{
		<!-- User  / Password -->
		<property name="connection.username">postgres</property>
		<property name="connection.password"></property>
		
		<property name="connection.url">jdbc:postgresql://YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE</property>	
    }}}
    Of course you must alter `YOUR_HOSTNAME/YOUR_DATABASE` to fit your needs for example to:`jdbc:postgresql://localhost/xmlcrm`
    * Any-Database-Users: Rename `any_hibernate.cfg.xml` to hibernate.cfg.xml. 
    Alter the following config values to fit your needs:
    {{{
		<!-- User  / Password -->
		<property name="connection.username">user</property>
		<property name="connection.password">*****</property>
		
		<!-- Database Settings -->
		<property name="connection.driver_class">org.postgresql.Driver</property>
		<property name="dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect</property>
		<property name="connection.url">jdbc:postgresql://localhost/xmlcrm</property>	
		
    }}}
    You can see a list of available _dialect_'s here [http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html#configuration-optional-dialects hibernate-SQL-dialects]. You must download the driver for your database and copy it to _$OPENMEETINGS-HOME/WEB-INF/lib_
  # (Re)start Red5 (The table's and default database scheme will be automatically created by hibernate if there is something wrong with your database values you will see errors in Red5 logfile, you can reduce Error log output by switching _$RED5_HOME/conf/log4j.properties from DEBUG to ERROR to see only relevant value's)
  # go to the Installer by accessing it via browser: http://$rmpthostlocal/xmlcrm/Install it looks like that (If you unpack your stuff on localhost and do not alter the red5 port settings it will be http://localhost:5080/xmlcrm/Install):
