#summary Documentation how Session-Variables are handled

There are multiple Session variables:

|| *Client Side name* || *Server Side name* || *description*  || *init-time / place* ||
|| canvas.streamid  || IConnection.getClient.getID() and org.xmlcrm.app.conference.videobeans.RoomClient.streamid || this is unique key for every rtmpconnection || invoked by Red5-Event: org.xmlcrm.app.remote.Application.roomJoin ||
|| conference.video.editRecordStream.broadcastId || org.xmlcrm.app.remote.Application.broadCastCounter || this is a unique key for every netstream/rtmpStream, you cannot use the streamid, cause if a user tries to reconnect his stream he cannot use the same Id for publishing his stream || org.xmlcrm.app.remote.Application.getBroadCastId invoked by editRecordStream.lzx Line 41 getBroadCastId.doCall() ||
|| canvas.sessionId || No Name stored in Database || The security Token || org.xmlcrm.app.remote.MainService.getsessiondata() by xmlcrm.hibernate.hibRtmpConnection.lzx Line 70 ||
|| canvas.publicSID || org.xmlcrm.app.conference.videobeans.RoomClient.publicSID || unique public SID, shared through RTMP-Reconnects, and Server-Side stored in RoomClient-Object, so this will be also send to all connected users, you cannot use the User_id here cause Guests have no User_id, you cannot use the canvas.sessionId for security reason || org.xmlcrm.app.remote.Application.getPublicSID and overwritePublicSID (invoked after reconnecting) both invoked by the client in hibRtmpConnection ||
