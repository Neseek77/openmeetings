#summary Howto switch between different version of FFMPEG
#labels Configuration

_this is available since version 1.9.x_

FFMPEG has a change in its API (possible since GIT revision 88bfe4518)

By default !OpenMeetings expects you to have a newer version of FFMPEG.

If you want to switch to the old style you can change that using the config key: {{{use.old.style.ffmpeg.map.option}}}
Set this value to {{{1}}} to have the old params in the API call to FFMPEG.
