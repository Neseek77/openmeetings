= Where to find language files =
You can find all current language files here:

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/webapp/xmlcrm/languages/

Just take one file and translate it to your language.

= How to add it as installation option =

At the moment you would have to recompile and alter the file:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/branches/dev/xmlcrm/java/src/app/org/xmlcrm/app/installation/ImportInitvalues.java

Issue 75 will solve that.
