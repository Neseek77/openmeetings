= Where to find language files =
You can find all current language files here:

http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webapp/webapp/openmeetings/languages/

Just take one file and translate it to your language.

= Import and export of Language Files =

  * *Use the [LanguageEditor] for translation*
  * with the [LanguageEditor] you can import and export Language Files

= How to add it as installation option =

Once you have finished the translation you can add a new node to:
http://openmeetings.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/webapp/webapp/openmeetings/languages/languages.xml

the name of the language should match the name of the file. Once this is done the Language file will automatically be imported during installation and will be an option at login.
