All language string should be localized and stored in the language section. You have a full featured language editor with every installation of !OpenMeetings, check out the LanguageEditor.

To lookup the labels in the GUI you can simply run !OpenMeetings client with the debug enabled. That way every text-string has the labelid in brackets additionally in the textfield.
To start the client in debug mode just add the param ?swf=maindebug.swf8.swf to the URL.
Example: http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/?swf=maindebug.swf8.swf
