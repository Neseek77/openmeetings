= Bandwidth rtmp/rtmpT connection =

  * 1 KB constant traffic á User

= Bandwidth - Conference Modus =

  * Download Stream around 16KBit
  * Upload Stream around 10 KBit
  * That means:
    1 Client = 3 DownStreams = 3*16 KBit = 48 DownStream AND 1 UpStream at 10 KB
    1 Server with 1 Conference á 4 People (Full Room) =
    4*3 Outgoing Streams á 16 KBit = 4*3*16 = 192 KBit Outgoing traffic
    4*1 Incoming Stream á 10 Kbit = 4*10 = 40KBit Incoming traffic


= Bandwidth - Audience Modus =

  * Download Stream around 16 KBit
  * Upload Stream around 12 KBit
  * That means:
    1 Client(Listener) = 1 DownStreams = 1*16 KBit = 16 DownStream
    OR
    1 Client(Moderator) = 1 UpStream = 1*12 KBit = 16 UpStream
    1 Server with 1 Conference á n People (Unlimited Room) =
    n*3 Outgoing Streams á 16 KBit = n*3*16 = UNLIMITED KBit Outgoing traffic
    1 Incoming Stream á 10 Kbit = 1*12 = 12KBit Incoming traffic
