#summary How To Report An Issue

=== How to report an Issue/Problem ===

First of all, if this problem is regarding installation of !OpenMeetings, then please visit and follow the Mailing list (see http://groups.google.com/group/openmeetings-user) ! An Installation problem is in 99% NO Issue.

But if there is an Issue related to our software then please first search the database if there is already an open ticket: <br/>
http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/issues/list

*If there is no Issue reported yet you can add a new one: 
http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/issues/entry *

New Issues have to be verified by someone of the team and assigned then to a person who will actual do the work. Please respect that people have to pay their bills, so customers come first!

If you wish certain items to be priorities or need help to solve your installation or customization project then please consider hiring someone from the [http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/wiki/Jobs list of developers].

If your Issue has the status *review* then its up to you to give a short comment in the issue that you are satisfied with the result. 
Normally each review status has a comment from the developer saying in which revision number (#r) the issue is solved. You may try one of the nightly builds (http://i4demo.com/openmeetings/builds/), each build has a #r number in its name.
