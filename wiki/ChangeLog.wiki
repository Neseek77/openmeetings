== Major changes in 0.8.4 ==

Release 0.8.4 basically adds some new SOAP Functions for directly entering and editing a Room. Some Room-Attributes have been removed that concern the Layout of a Room. However you may still use the previous SOAP Calls but it is recommended to Update to use the latest API-Calls see [SoapMethods].

The Moodle Plugin enables you now to use more feature of !OpenMeetings:
  * Create both Room Types Conference Room (Multiple Videos) and Event Room (Single Bigger Video)
  * Set an individual Room Language and Max Number of Participant per Room
  * Set a Flag for a Room so that Students and Guests have to wait and will NOT become the Moderation Role in a Conference Room by default, they will have to wait untill a Moodle-Teacher, -Admin or -Creating-Teacher comes and enters a Room.

We would like to thank all Contributors, User, Developers of !OpenMeetings and [http://www.openkvarken.fi/ Open Kvarken] for supporting us.


Notes:

In the Administration I just encountered an Issue with 0.8.4: 
In the Admin Panel of Rooms as => the Admin-Panel expects that there is at least a
number in the Field *demo-Time* ... so when you try to add a new Room it says
System Error. You can workaround that by enabling *Demo Room* (the checkbox)
enter a number in *demo Time* .. you can then disable that again and save the
Room. r2100 should fix this already.

  * Updated Italian Lang-File
  * Fixed Button to Invitation (moved to Menu Bar)
