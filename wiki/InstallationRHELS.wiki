#INSTALLATION OF OPENMEETINGS ON RHELS 5.6 x64 (Tikanga)

= INSTALLATION OF OPENMEETINGS ON RHELS 5.6 x64 (Tikanga) =

We start from a fresh installation with a MySQL database configured and 
running.

== 1.INSTALL IMAGEMAGICK ==

{{{ 
yum install imagemagick
}}}

Ghostscript-8.70-6.el5.x86_64 was already installed in my case

== 2. INSTALL SWFTOOLS ==

It's not in the RHEL repos, so we  have to download it;

{{{
wget http://www.swftools.org/swftools-0.9.1.tar.gz
}}}

Before compiling we must install some dependenies;

{{{
yum install zlib-devel libjpeg-devel.x86_64 freetype-devel giflib-devel
}}}

We compile swftools as always;

{{{
tar -xzvf swftools-0.9.1.tar.gz
./configure
make
make install
}}}
