#summary One-sentence summary of this page.

There is a MySQL sample config: postgres_persistance.xml that ships with every release of !OpenMeetings.

=== Before you start ===

  * Make sure that you have set utf8 as default/server-character-set
  * make sure Postgres is listening on TCP/IP connections!

To verify if Postgres connection is working: !OpenMeetings will automatically create all tables in the database.

  * If you encounter issues, you can drop the db again and delete the file $red5/webapps/openmeetings/conf/install.xml and then run the web based installer again

=== Steps todo ==

  # Rename<br/>$red5/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/postgres_persistance.xml<br/>to<br/>$red5/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/persistance.xml
  # Prepare Database Settings - go to openmeetings_version_no_xx/webapps/openmeetings/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/persistance.xml 
  # Run red5-service and goto the web-based installer: http://localhost:5080/openmeetings/install
