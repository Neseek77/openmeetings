<!---Tag for including fonts.
The <font> tag is used to import fonts into an LZX application. Each font in an LZX application has a source file (in TrueType format), a name, and a style (plain, bold, italic, or bold italic).

A font element within a <canvas> or <library> defines a font, which can be referenced by the font attribute of a view, or by the face attribute of the <font> tag within HTML markup. A font element can define a single font face or style, by using the src attribute to refer to a TrueType font that is included in the application.
